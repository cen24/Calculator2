# **Calculator 2**

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cen24/Calculator2.svg?branch=master)

Forked from [MiniProject 2](https://github.com/cen24/miniproject2)

For this homework, you need to create a new branch of your calculator project or you can make a new project. In this branch, you need to follow this tutorial: https://overiq.com/sqlalchemy-101/crud-using-sqlalchemy-orm/

This tutorial required me to follow previous hands on tutorials to get sqlAlchemy to work with sqlite instead of the Postgres connection used with the project.
